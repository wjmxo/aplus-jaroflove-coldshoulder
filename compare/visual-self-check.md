# Visual Self-Check

## Generated Asset Rule
- `assets/color-*.jpg` is now used only as garment reference input and is not directly referenced by the active module artwork.
- New generated assets are stored in `assets/gen/` and documented in `assets/gen/INDEX.md`.
- Final cutout model PNGs use transparent backgrounds with white sticker-style outline and soft shadow in the HTML.
- New pose assets added this round: `gen-model-wine-side-01.png`, `gen-model-white-back-01.png`, and `gen-model-red-sit-02.png`. Pose check contact sheet is saved at `compare/pose-generated-check.jpg`.

## Continuous Canvas 01-03
- Source: `modules/continuous-01-03.html`
- Output master: `output/continuous-01-03.png`
- Slice outputs: `module-01-hero.png`, `module-02-detail-grid.png`, `module-03-fabric.png`
- Slice safety: y=600 crosses the soft camel transition band and the wine anchor model torso; y=1200 crosses the neutral transition band near lower-body/blank zones. Faces, hands, headlines, button macro cards, and key text stay at least 60px away from the slice line.
- Layout change: main model is a cutout sticker, not a rectangular photo card. Detail and fabric images remain rectangular white cards as allowed small/detail images.
- Required decorative elements: one large two-line `Henley Mood` script title, small `Detail Proof` / `Soft Touch` script accents, watermark letters, # tags, and curled dashed arrows are present.
- Rule 17 typography: uses italic serif notes, expanded-letter labels, 7.5% translucent watermark words, brown + dark gray script accents, and wavy underlines without adding font families.
- Anchor/protagonist check: the wine anchor is the largest element and crosses the 01/02 slice through torso only; each module has one immediately legible protagonist.
- Verdict: pass after moving script titles away from key headings and moving the hero detail card clear of the slice line.

## Continuous Canvas 04-05
- Source: `modules/continuous-04-05.html`
- Output master: `output/continuous-04-05.png`
- Slice outputs: `module-04-scenarios.png`, `module-05-styling-color.png`
- Slice safety: y=600 falls through the camel divider and the white anchor model waist/sleeve low-detail area, not through faces, hands, or titles.
- Layout change: all main models are transparent cutout stickers. The color module uses generated cutout models plus the generated accessory flat-lay group instead of direct product-photo crops.
- Required decorative elements: one large two-line `Outfit Notes` script title, small `Color Story` script accent, curled dashed arrows, # tags, swatches, and accessory flat-lay are present.
- Rule 17 typography: uses italic serif notes, expanded-letter `SIDE VIEW` / `FIVE SHADES` labels, 7.5% translucent watermark words, brown + dark gray script accents, and wavy underlines without adding font families.
- Anchor/protagonist check: the white anchor is the largest element and crosses the 04/05 slice through torso/hip only; module 05 keeps `FIND YOUR EVERYDAY SHADE` fully readable above the swatches.
- Verdict: pass after moving swatches away from the title and separating script accents from cutout models.

## Module 06 - Size Chart
- Source: `modules/module-06-size-chart.html`
- Output: `output/module-06-size-chart.png`
- Result: right side now uses a real generated cutout model, not a placeholder or CSS/SVG garment drawing.
- Measurement marks: white dashed BUST / LENGTH / SLEEVE labels are overlaid directly on the model area.
- Table style: rows use alternating light pink and light camel stripes.
- Verdict: pass.

## Module 07 - Brand Story Closing
- Source: `modules/module-07-brand-story.html`
- Output: `output/module-07-brand-story.png`
- Result: color cards now use generated cutout model assets from `assets/gen/` instead of direct `assets/color-*.jpg` crops.
- Verdict: pass.

## Residual Risk
- Generated model identity is close enough for a unified A+ page but not perfectly identical across every pose.
- The generated garment details passed the visible check for notched split V neckline, two marble-look buttons, long sleeves, rib texture, and color family, but final production proof can still be improved with real photography later.
- Face/hand zoom check is saved at `compare/cutout-face-hand-check.jpg`; no malformed faces or fingers were found in the current portrait set.
- Pixel slice verification is saved at `compare/slice-verification.md`; all continuous-canvas slices match the exported module images.
