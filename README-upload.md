# ELARAISE Premium A+ Upload Guide

Product: Women's Long Sleeve Henley V Neck Slim Fit Ribbed Top  
ASIN focus: B0H1X6VPMM

## Output Files

All image files are exported at 2x resolution for clarity. Upload them to matching Premium A+ modules as image assets.

Modules 01-03 are designed as one continuous 1464 x 1800 canvas and sliced into three 1464 x 600 modules. Modules 04-05 are designed as one continuous 1464 x 1200 canvas and sliced into two 1464 x 600 modules. Use `render.cjs` or `render-continuous.cjs`, then run `scripts/slice_continuous.py`, `scripts/visual_compare.py`, and `scripts/make_contact_sheet.py`.

Current artwork uses generated assets from `assets/gen/`; `assets/color-*.jpg` remains as garment-fidelity reference only and is not directly placed in the final module images.

## Backend Text Fields

Use the approved copy in `copy.md`. Keep wording focused on verified attributes:

- Use `Decorative Buttons` wherever the Henley close-up appears.
- Do not mention price, discount, ranking, reviews, or comparison to another brand.
- Do not claim non-sheer, double-lined, or opaque unless confirmed by real product photography.
- Fit guidance may say: `For a more relaxed look, consider choosing one size up.`

## Final Checks Before Upload

- Confirm Module 06 size data matches Seller Central variation attributes.
- Replace the Module 06 `待素材` placeholder with a real measurement-guide photo if available.
- Check every backend image crop after upload; Amazon may preview modules differently from local PNGs.
- Keep all uploaded text in U.S. English and avoid promotional or absolute claims.
