## Rule 22 Gaze / Expression Audit

Official `gen-*` assets after this run: 39.

| Group | Assets | Gaze / expression status |
|---|---|---|
| Active calm anchors and protagonists | `gen-portrait-black-anchor-01.png`, `gen-model-black-back-01.png`, `gen-model-black-sidewalk-01.png`, `gen-model-duo-black-front-white-back-01.png` | Uses looking-away, over-shoulder, and focused side-view reads; active page avoids all-camera-facing repetition |
| Approved varied color/support assets | `gen-model-white-side-01.png`, `gen-model-red-sit-02.png`, `gen-model-wine-side-01.png`, `gen-model-black-sit-01.png` | Used to diversify color-card head direction and pose |
| Draft redundancy pool | `gen-portrait-wine-01.png`, `gen-portrait-black-01.png`, `gen-portrait-red-01.png`, `gen-model-wine-01.png`, `gen-model-brown-01.png`, `gen-model-red-01.png`, `gen-portrait-black-close-01.png` | Marked Draft in `INDEX.md` because they repeat camera-facing / soft-smile direction too often |
| Optional future补货 | Black downward-looking sleeve-adjusting cutout | Only needed if a future layout must explicitly show the "低头" gaze class in a main model |

## Quality Gate Notes

- Garment fidelity: visible neckline/buttons/rib texture checked against `assets/color-black.jpg` and `assets/color-white.jpg`.
- Human realism: generated model assets passed visible face/hand check at thumbnail and enlarged review level.
- Composition reserve: scene assets include warm low-detail background areas for future typography.
- Naming: final assets use the `gen-{type}-{color}-{pose-or-scene}-{number}.png` pattern.

## Shortage Request List

None. The core pack is complete for user review.

## Stop Point

Stop here and wait for user asset-library approval. Do not enter phase-two page production until the user explicitly confirms the asset library.
